This directory contains the examples used in the lectures for CSCM13/CSC313.
Note many examples in the lectures are meant to demonstrate that Spark Ada 
rejects code which has errors or could result in errors, so  not all code
will compile or pass spark ada tests.

In many cases comments in the code indicate these deliberate errrors, and there
might be as well a README.txt file explaining it. 

At the time of writing this README.txt file, I have gone through the code and made
these amendments for misc and sections until including Sect. 5 

If there are any errors please report them to Anton Setzer a.g.setzer@swansea.ac.uk
